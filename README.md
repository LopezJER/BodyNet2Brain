Mapping representations in the visual cortex with body-parsing neural networks

The purpose of this study is to unravel representations in visual cortical regions with body-parsing neural networks (i.e., pose estimation and body segmentation models). Specifically, it aims to:

1. Perform Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) between neural networks and visual cortical regions.
2. Conduct variance partitioning to determine the contributions of each neural network model to explaining the variance in the neural responses in visual cortical regions.
