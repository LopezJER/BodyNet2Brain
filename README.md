Mapping representations in the visual cortex with body-parsing neural networks

The purpose of this study is to unravel representations in body-selective brain regions (i.e., EBA and FBA) with body-parsing neural networks (i.e., pose estimation and body segmentation models). Specifically, it aims to:

1. Perform Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) between neural networks and body-selective brain regions.
2. Conduct variance partitioning to determine the contributions of each neural network model to explaining the variance in the neural responses in body-selective brain regions.
